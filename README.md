CarteretLogger
==============

A new version of the Carteret water quality Arduino program. This version utilized a float switch, RTC and SD card, and should function both as an event logger (ie when it was called by the scan to take a sample) but also whether or not there was water in the ditch at that time, and thus, whether or not it followed through with that command.
